# Route-Analyzer
This repository is Maddox Scott’s IB Computer Science Internal Assessment submission of 2022, which received the highest class grade of all juniors with a 116/120.

The internal assessment consists of a mobile application that can comparatively analyze two different GPS route files imported from major activity-tracking applications such as Strava.

The project is separated into two sections: Documentation and Product. 

In the documentation directory are several files which highlight and reveal the design process of creating the application, as well as preproduction conducted with the client. The MP4 file titled “Crit_D_Video” comprehensively displays all major functions of the application.

In the product directory is the executable of the application, which is written in Dart using the Flutter SDK. The application is capable of operating on both Android and IOS devices. The entirety of the code, along with comments explaining each algorithm, is present. To avoid git security concerns, the Google Maps API key has been removed from this public repository to prevent malicious actions.
